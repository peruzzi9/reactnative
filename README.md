- Note : React Native's <Button /> component does not accept a style prop, and its color prop is limited and appears differently across Android, iOS, and the web. With the <Pressable /> component, we can create custom buttons that fit our app's design. Those styles will also be the same across Android, iOS, and the web, which will give our apps a consistent look on every platform.
